# odin-calculator
This project is an integral part of The Odin Project's Foundations course, designed to help learners strengthen their fundamental web development skills. The main objective is to create a functional calculator using a combination of JavaScript for the logic, HTML for structuring the calculator's elements, and CSS for styling.

Throughout the project, students are expected to demonstrate their ability to work with JavaScript's logic, data manipulation, and event handling to make the calculator perform basic arithmetic operations. Additionally, it offers hands-on experience with the Document Object Model (DOM) as students need to dynamically update the calculator's display and respond to user inputs.

Importantly, this project encourages creative freedom in terms of visual design and styling. Learners can apply their CSS skills to customize the calculator's appearance, allowing for personalization and a chance to practice CSS concepts such as layout, color schemes, and typography.

In summary, this project is a practical exercise that assesses and reinforces key web development skills, including JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and CSS styling, within the context of building a functional calculator.
