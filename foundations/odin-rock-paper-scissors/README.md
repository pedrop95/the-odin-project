# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This project was part of The Odin Project's 'Foundations' course and involved creating a simple web page featuring a rock-paper-scissors game, which allowed the development of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. Alongside the skills taught in the course, such as structuring with HTML, styling with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript, the project also encompassed incorporating dynamic HTML manipulation through JavaScript functionalities. The objective of this project was successfully realized, marking its completion and providing students with hands-on experience in amalgamating these fundamental web development languages to construct a fully functional game interface. Through the project, students acquired a solid foundation in web development by applying these skills in a practical context.
